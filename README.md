# Pyramid-Blending
Python code that photoshops one image onto another

Together with a team of four we created a program that when an image is selected a certain size of that image, which is also selected by the user, is saved. Another image form your comptuer also appears and once again the user must select that image. Through the application of laplacan images and gaussian blending, we are able to perfectly mold the first image onto the next.
